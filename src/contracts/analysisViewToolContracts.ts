      "Inspect selected views of completed binary-layout, JavaScript application, native analyze_function, inspect_artifact or inventory_artifact Evidence without repeating analysis. Use an exact same-session retained evidence_id or portable inline Evidence. Select a summary, layout mitigations/linkage facet, one section/symbol/module, or a stable page. Module pages include assets, bundled and source modules; use node_id for ambiguous or unavailable paths. Inventory views page nodes, occurrences, edges or integrity contradictions; occurrence logical_paths matches exact recorded strings (omitted means all available, [] means none). source_complete distinguishes complete inventories from partial source records; page exhaustion does not prove absence in a partial source. Native views select procedure, pseudocode, assembly, basic blocks, comments, callers/callees, references, unresolved calls, referenced strings/names, native API and high-pcode. Use nonnegative offset and a positive caller-selected limit (defaults 0 and 64); pseudocode uses UTF-16 code units, other native pages use rows. Returns artifact identity, parent Evidence ID, a distinct view digest, coverage, limitations and unknowns. Actual serialized size determines MCP transport admission; choose a smaller page or export the complete retained Evidence if needed.",
